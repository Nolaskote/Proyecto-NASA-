                <p>“We are the 'Elves of the Universe' team, a multidisciplinary group of Ecuadorians united by our
                    passion for the cosmos. Our team is made up of two physicists, Alexander and Nolasco, a mechatronic
                    engineer, Robinson, and a software technician, Adilem. We were motivated to participate in this
                    competition with the goal of offering an innovative experience in the exploration of our Solar
                    System. ¡We hope you enjoy our interactive model and live an amazing experience on your journey
                    through space!”
